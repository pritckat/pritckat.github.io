I'm trying to like JavaScript, I promise. And I'm trying to see how it has improved my project. No, really. But I fell in love with Rails slowly and deeply and it did at first seem like JS had shown up to be a third wheel and get in the way of the beautiful thing Rails and I had made. And to get me to pull my hair out with its impossile syntax and cryptic error messages. I won't say that I enjoy JS at this point, but I did get to add features to my Book Loaning App that I really wanted to. For that, I must begrudgingly thank JS.

New to the app are: Comments! And, because no opinion on the internet should go unchallenged: Replies! On the book show page, you can now see a JS rendered index of comment (or review) titles and their authors with a link to each comment's show page. So now, whether you borrowed a book or not, you can write a review of it to help others decide if they'd like to read it and share your thoughts on it as a whole. As a great lover of books and reviews, this was an important feature, to me, to add to the app and I'm thoroughly pleased it is now implemented.

My favorite new feature involves the new comments. Now when you open one book's comment, you can use a 'Next' or 'Prev' button to maneuver through all the comments a book has received. Of all the new features, this one is the most useful. You can even reply to each comment on these pages.

I might, in the future come back and add more features (ratings?) to Book Loaning App, but for now I'm satisfied with it. One can log when they loan books to their friends and keep track of books they borrow. You can comment on books and discuss them with other users. These are the things I wanted the app to do, and now it does.
