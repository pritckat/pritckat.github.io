I really had no idea what to do for my first project in Ruby. Actually, it was the first coding project of my whole life that was mine and mine alone with no one overseeing my tasks or collaborating. I'd like to say it felt good to have the freedom, but I immediately got the "blank screen syndrome". Have I ever written a program before? Do I even know where to type anything? How can one be *really sure* that they're in the right directory? Cue two whole days of anxiety.

But, eventually, I  decided I had more than enough resources to get me through. Or that if I didn't I was really hopeless. I'd spent a lot of time watching the 2018 Overwatch World Cup during my 'avoid the project' spell and decided that I was perfectly capable of scraping a website for team info and player info, something I actually did want to look up. So many players in the World Cup aren't in the Overwatch League at a professional level, and I've never heard of them and had been googling them anyway. Plus, it's cool to see how the League teams get shuffled up into their country teams for the World Cup.

I decided to start my program by just typing out a menu in a 'Cli class'. Then I filled in methods and other classes as my menu required them. The end product allows you to either see a list of teams or players, and then to view more information on either one. I like that I managed to make it so that you never have to leave the program if you want to view another player or team, you can just go back to the menu or keep typing in players whose stats you'd like to see.

The only major hang-up I had was what to do when a player's profile doesn't exist on the website I'm scraping. It took me a long time to figure out how to get it to stop and just print an error message. I'd entirely forgotten about custom errors.

In the future, I'd like to add more functionality to the project. I'd like to be able to have a 'Role' class and a 'Hero' class so that you could search for all players filling a Tank role or all players who primarily use Widowmaker. But for now I'm going to be happy with my working project that lists all players on teams, and tells me what I'd like to know about them.
